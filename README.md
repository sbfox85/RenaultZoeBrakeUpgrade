# RenaultZoeBrakeUpgrade
Upgrading brakes on Renault Zoe Ph1 to 312mm VW Calipers and Discs, and Rear Discs &amp; Calipers.

Rear Brakes

I decided to use front wheel bearings from a Mk7 VW Golf. These would allow a driveshaft to be used in the future, are a 4 bolt fitment, and are relatively cheap. The incorporate the Magnetic ABS Wheel and will work with 2wire active ABS sensors (the VW part should be compatible with the Renault ABS control unit).

I created a 2 part adapter. One is the Aluminium backplate which incorporates the brake caliper mounts and a locating part for the Zoe axle, and the scond is a Steel housing that holds the ABS sensor and wheel bearing.
